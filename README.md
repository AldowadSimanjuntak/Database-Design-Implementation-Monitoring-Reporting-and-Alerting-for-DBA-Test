# Final Internship Project - Kalbe Nutritional

This repository contains the codebase for my final internship project at Kalbe Nutritional. The project aimed to showcase my skills in designing and implementing a PostgreSQL database, encompassing various aspects such as data normalization, schema creation, and query optimization.

## Project Highlights

- **PostgreSQL Database Design:** I meticulously designed the database to ensure optimal performance, data integrity, and scalability.

- **Data Normalization:** Implemented effective data normalization techniques to minimize redundancy and enhance database efficiency.

- **Integration of Excel Data:** The project involved seamless integration of Excel data into the PostgreSQL database, ensuring a smooth transition of information.

- **Report and Alerts Creation:** I developed a reporting system with customized queries to generate meaningful insights. Additionally, alerts were implemented to notify users based on specific conditions.

- **Precise Query Optimization:** Customized queries were fine-tuned to align with precise requirements and demands, optimizing the overall database performance.
